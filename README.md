## About the project
The project was created as a part of Web Developer bootcamp in order to learn how to use JavaScript plugins. The carousel presents some information about the most famous mounds in Cracow. The slides are connected with the markers on the map below and an active slide is connected with a green marker. As a result, the following functionalities are enabled:
* changing center of the map while changing active slide,
* changing active slide while clicking on unactive marker (red marker connected with unactive slide),
* restarting carousel to the first slide.
